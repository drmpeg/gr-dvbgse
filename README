The goal of this project is to build a GNU Radio block that implements
the ETSI TS 102 606-1 V1.2.1 Generic Stream Encapsulation standard:

http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102600_102699/10260601/01.02.01_60/ts_10260601v010201p.pdf

Usage:

Because the Pcap library is used to capture raw packets, the capabilities
of the Python interpreter need to be increased. This only needs to be
done once.

sudo setcap 'CAP_NET_RAW+eip CAP_NET_ADMIN+eip' /usr/bin/python2.7

CAUTION: This allows any Python program to open network interfaces.

The current implementation of the block uses a TAP network interface
named tap0.

To add a TAP interface (with ip(8) commands):

sudo ip tuntap add dev tap0 mode tap

sudo ip link set dev tap0 address 02:00:48:55:4c:4b

sudo ip addr add 44.0.0.1/24 dev tap0

sudo ip link set tap0 mtu 4096 arp off

To delete the TAP interface:

sudo ip tuntap del dev tap0 mode tap

Dependencies:

libpcap-dev

Build instructions:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig

Contributions are welcome!
